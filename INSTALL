    Installing Task-Tiny should be straightforward.

INSTALLATION WITH CPANMINUS
    If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

            % cpanm Task::Tiny

    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass
    the "-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

            % cpanm -S Task::Tiny

INSTALLATION WITH THE CPAN SHELL
    Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to
    do:

            % cpan Task::Tiny

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball and
    unpack it.

    Consult the file META.json for a list of pre-requisites. Install these
    first.

    To build Task-Tiny:

            % perl Makefile.PL
            % make && make test

    Then install it:

            % make install

    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

            % sudo make install

OPTIONAL FEATURES
    Task-Tiny provides several optional features, which may require additional
    pre-requisites. These features are:

    *   Filesys (File system manipulation)

    *   HTTP (Web stuff)

    *   JSON (JSON stuff)

    *   Objects (Framework for OO programming)

    *   Types (Type constraint framework)

    *   Util (General utilities)

    *   YAML (YAML stuff)

    cpanminus 1.7000 and above support installing optional features:

            % cpanm --with-feature=Filesys Task::Tiny

    Otherwise, Makefile.PL can prompt you to select features. Set the
    `MM_INSTALL_FEATURES` environment variable to "1" before running
    Makefile.PL.
